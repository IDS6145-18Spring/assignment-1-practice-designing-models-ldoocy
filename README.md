## General Introduction

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently. Our goal is to create a city with as low of a carbon footprint as possible. Many cities, communities, and campuses have already established goals of reaching a climate neutral state.

Traffic congestion, espeically during rush hour, is a major problem in larger cities. While it is incovenient for individuals that commute to work, it also has negative effects on the environment. CO2 emissions produced by the operation of standard vehicles makes up for a majority of daily greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States. Among the environmental benefits that would be seen by reduced congestion, it would provide a safer environment to live in. Traffic accidents make up for numerous deaths nationwide and are are more likely to happen with more cars on the road.

This model is an agent based model where data is kept on the daily modes of transportation used by commuters. In an attempt to lower GHG emissions, it will attempt to lower the number of single passenger cars on the road. Less single passenger cars may mean more commuters are using public transportation, more people are using alternate routes, or more people are carpooling. The one thing that these things have in common is a reduction of cars on the road, and the reduction of average time a car spends on the road.

For the purposes of making reasonable change, we will focus on users commuting to and from work and school. This is the most consistent transportation by users. A majority of users perform this action 5 times a week. Where as transportation to the grocery store, gym, mall, etc do not happen as regularily.

Through this simulation we will gain a better understanding of what drives our users to use certain modes of transportation. While convenience is a giant playing card in what drives agents to do what they do, heavy traffic congestion at rush hour is not convenient for anyone. Thus, through incentives, widened variety of safe transportation options, among other things that drive people, we seek to decrease congestion on roadways during rush hour and therefore lowering GHG emissions generated.

## Requirements

(remove: You should start by specifying a set of requirements. I specified a topic Smart Cities but what exactly does that mean-  you should practice formulating your own set of requirements and an experiment. Define a hypothesis of a problem cities face and how a smart city would possibly help alleviate this issue. This helps you think about your problem communication and system objectives inputs, functions, and outputs - they should be clearly specified.)

Functional Requirements: The system will reduce the number of single passenger cars on the road.

## Smart City Transportation Model

This model makes an effort at indentifying the transportation of choice by residents of a city. When preferences are identified, we can further aim to reduce the number of solo drivers on the road.

## Smart City Transportation Simulation

This is the rough plan for the [**Smart City Transportation Model**](model/README.md) simulation. Much of this type of progress will be made after understanding what motivates specific types of people to use certain modes of transportation to get to work.
