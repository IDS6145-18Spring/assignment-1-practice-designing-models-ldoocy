## General Introduction

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

(remove: States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(remove: Add real-world examples, if any)
(remove: Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

Our goal is to create a city with as low of a carbon footprint as possible. Many cities, communities, and campuses have already established goals of reaching a climate neutral state.

There are numerous variables that stand to be managed such that a city is considered efficient. One of Orlando's largest issues is major traffic congestion on Interstate 4. This problem is inconvienient for those individuals commuting to work and school, as this issue is most present during morning and evening rush hour times. In addition to the annoyance, the number of cars and extended time on the road has negative effects on the environment.

CO2 emissions produced by the operation of standard vehicles makes up for a majority of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Orlando, which is known as a commuter city, inherently has higher GHG emissions per capita than that of a city which utilizes public transportation.

Among the environmental benefits that would be seen with reduced total drivetime for Orlando residents, it would produce a safer envrionment to live in. Traffic accidents make up for numerous deaths in Central Florida. Accident such as these are more likely to happen with more cars on the road.

Orlando's traffic conjection issues stem from the large number of commuters with too few driving options and public transportation option. There are many people are driving rather than taking public transportation, walking, or carpooling.

There are many ways to lower GHG emissions. The most obvious solution is to have less drivers on the road.

Orlando needs more public transportation options
Orlando needs less drivers on the road, encouragement of carpooling
Orlando needs alternate driving route to I4
Orlando needs more greenery to combat CO2 emissions

## Requirements (Experimental Design)

(remove: You should start by specifying a set of requirements. I specified a topic Smart Cities but what exactly does that mean-  you should practice formulating your own set of requirements and an experiment. Define a hypothesis of a problem cities face and how a smart city would possibly help alleviate this issue. This helps you think about your problem communication and system objectives inputs, functions, and outputs - they should be clearly specified.)

## Smart City (My Problem) Model

(remove: add a high-level overview of your model, the part below should link to the model directory markdown files)
(remove: Look at the [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) for how to structure this part of Part 2 for each diagram. Only the Object diagram has the template, the rest are blank. )

* [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) - provides the high level overview of components
* [**Class Diagram**](model/class_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Behavior Diagram**](model/behavior_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Agent / User case** (if appropriate)](model/agent_usecase_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)

## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

(remove: for part 3 add two to three sentences here and link the [**(your own name)**](model/README.md) file in the analysis folder - which describe how you would simulate this - type of simulation, rough details -inputs, outputs - how it will help you analyze your experimental hypothesis, or nullify your null hypothesis.)
